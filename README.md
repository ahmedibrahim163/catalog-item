This application provides a list of items within a variety of categories 
as well as provide a user registration(google or facebook) and authentication system. 
Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

# What Will I Learn?
You will learn how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along
 with implementing third-party OAuth authentication. 
 You will then learn when to properly use the various HTTP methods available to you 
 and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.
